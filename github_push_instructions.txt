HOW TO PUSH YOUR CODE TO GITHUB
==========================

1. First, create a repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name your repository "frontronics"
   - Choose public or private visibility
   - Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
   - Click "Create repository"

2. After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands to push your code.
   Copy and run the following commands (replace YOUR-USERNAME with your actual GitHub username):

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/frontronics.git
git push -u origin main

3. If you encounter authentication issues, try using a personal access token:
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
   - Generate a new token with "repo" permissions
   - Then use the token in place of your password when prompted

4. Alternatively, you can use GitHub CLI (if installed):

gh repo create frontronics --private --source=. --push

This will create the repository and push your code in one step.
